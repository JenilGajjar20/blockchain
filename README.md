# Blockchain ðŸ¤‘

Welcome to the Blockchain project! This simple blockchain implementation is designed for educational purposes and can be enhanced with new features over time.

## Overview

This project showcases a basic blockchain with features such as mining, dynamic reward distribution, and hash validation. It allows users to interact with the blockchain by adding blocks with associated data.

<!-- ## Features

- **Mining:** Blocks are mined with **[proof-of-work](http://tinyurl.com/y4cju3mp)**, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Dynamic Rewards:** The miner reward decreases over time based on a customizable halving interval.
- **Hash Validation:** Validates the hashes of blocks to detect any tampering or inconsistencies. -->

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blockchain.git
```

- Make sure to replace **"your-username"** in the clone URL with your GitHub username.

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd Blockchain
npm install
```

3. Run the application

```bash
node main.js
```

## Usage

Follow the prompts to interact with the blockchain. Enter the number of blocks and provide data for each block when prompted.The blockchain will be displayed, and hash validation will be performed.
